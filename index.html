        <!-- <h2> About Me </h2> -->

        <p>
        I was born in Kampala, Uganda, and have lived there most of my life. I love to play soccer (football), basketball, and cross-country. I also love to read books, play guitar and draw.
        I currently work as a part-time digital analyst for an e-commerce startup called Ugify, and I also helped develop the online shop frontend and the backend. I am also a Master's student
        at Bridgewater State Univeristy, scheduled to graduate in December 2023!
